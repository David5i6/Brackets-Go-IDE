# Go - IDE
##### Brackets Go-IDE plugin
----
This is a little project to develop a IDE functionality for Go language on top of brackets.

Actually it uses ``gocode`` for autocompletion, so you need to get and install it.

It also adds some hints by itself (go-lang internal functions and primitives not suggested by ``gocode`` ).


You can get ``gocode`` here:
